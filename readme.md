## by Masa Abdalhalim


## Dataset

The data for this project is from the ford gobike which has around 1863721 entries with 16 features (duration_sec, start_time, end_time, start_station_id, start_station_name, start_station_latitude, start_station_longitude, end_station_id, end_station_name, end_station_latitude ,end_station_longitude, bike_id, user_type, member_birth_year, member_gender, bike_share_for_all_trip).

## Summary of Findings

Trip Duration is so dependendable on the age of the member, the age is between 25 to 45, the trip duration is higher than the older ages. I also found that there are two types of clients using the system those are subscribers and customers, subscribers use it for shorter trips than customers.

## Key Insights for Presentation
